# RIPE IPv6 Route Collector

This project automates the retrieval and processing of IPv6 BGP routing data from RIPE RIS.
It downloads the latest `bview` BGP dumps from all 26 RRCs (rrc00 to rrc25), extracts unique IPv6 prefixes, and logs them into a file.

## üöÄ How It Works

* Downloads BGP dump files (`bview`) from the RIPE RIS archive
* Extracts all valid IPv6 prefixes using `bgpdump`
* Stores results in `ipv6log.txt`
* Avoids reprocessing already-handled files (tracks via `.last_processed_rib.txt`)

## ‚è∞ Automation via Cron

To run the job every day at 8 AM:

```bash
0 8 * * * /path/to/ripe-ipv6-collector/scripts/ribupdates.sh >> /path/to/ripe-ipv6-collector/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

> Replace `/path/to/` with your actual path

Save this in your crontab using:

```bash
crontab -e
```

---

## üì¶ Requirements

* `bash`
* `wget`
* `bgpdump` (BGP data parser)
* `cron` (for scheduled runs)

Install `bgpdump` via:

```bash
sudo apt install bgpdump
```
